# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the marts or staging directories
# as tables. These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
